    142                    387.2                   34                   78.5%
   62.1% of days          4.8 hrs per day        2.1 papers/year     sessions with others
```

### Activity Calendar: Research Heatmap
**Academic version of surfing sessions:**
- **Research Activity Calendar**: Darker squares = more productive days
- **Color coding**: Writing (green), Lab work (blue), Teaching (orange), Conferences (purple)
- **Hover details**: "March 15: 6 hours writing, 2 hours data analysis"
- **Yearly overview with seasonal patterns**

### Goal Tracking: Academic Milestones
**Progress visualization for academic goals:**
- **Annual Publication Goal**: Visual progress bar with projections
- **Citation Growth**: Actual vs. predicted trajectory
- **Grant Application Timeline**: Deadlines and submission status
- **Conference Presentations**: Speaking engagement tracking

## Typography & Personality

### Voice & Tone Translation
**From Surfer Diary's casual personality to Academic Authenticity:**

**Original**: "I'm weird and track my surfing like I'm training for the WSL"
**Academic**: "I track my research productivity obsessively because data-driven insights improve academic outcomes (and my advisor appreciates the transparency)"

**Original**: "My data is much more detailed from 2024 onward"
**Academic**: "My tracking became more sophisticated after starting my postdoc—that's when I began collecting granular data to optimize my research workflow"

### Font Choices
- **Headers**: Inter or Source Sans Pro (clean, modern, academic-appropriate)
- **Body**: System fonts (SF Pro, Segoe UI) for readability
- **Data/Numbers**: JetBrains Mono for monospaced precision
- **Accent Text**: Crimson Text for academic gravitas when needed

## Academic-Specific Visualizations

### 1. Publication Timeline & Impact
**Replace surfing waves with research milestones:**
- **Timeline visualization**: Papers plotted by publication date
- **Impact bubbles**: Citation counts as bubble sizes
- **Journal prestige**: Color-coded by journal impact factor
- **Collaboration networks**: Co-author connections

### 2. Research Activity Heatmap
**Academic equivalent of session calendar:**
- **Daily research intensity**: Color-coded productivity levels
- **Activity types**: Different colors for writing, data collection, analysis, teaching
- **Seasonal patterns**: Conference seasons, grant deadlines, semester cycles
- **Productivity insights**: Best days/times for different activities

### 3. Citation Flow & Impact Visualization
**Research impact over time:**
- **Citation accumulation**: Flowing visualization of how citations grow
- **Paper influence**: Network diagram showing which papers cite each other
- **Impact prediction**: Projected citation trajectories
- **Field positioning**: How work fits within broader research landscape

### 4. Collaboration Network
**Academic relationship mapping:**

## Content Strategy & Storytelling

### Personal Academic Narrative
**Translate Surfer Diary's storytelling approach:**

**Bio Section Example:**
"I'm a computational biologist who tracks research productivity like others track fitness goals. My data obsession started during my PhD when I realized that small daily habits compound into major research breakthroughs. Plus, I needed concrete evidence for my partner that late-night lab sessions actually lead somewhere meaningful 😅"
