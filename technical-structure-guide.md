```yaml
# User fills out a simple form that generates:
profile.yaml:
  name: "Dr. Sarah Chen"
  position: "Assistant Professor"
  institution: "Stanford University"
  orcid: "0000-0000-0000-0000"
  bio: "Computational biologist studying..."
  
# Site builds automatically with:
- Responsive design

## Technical Implementation Details

### Development Framework (Vercel-Optimized)
```javascript
// Leveraging Vercel's Next.js optimizations
const AcademicProfile = () => {
  const { user, loading } = useAuth()
  const { modules } = useUserModules()
  
  return (
    <Layout>
      <ProfileHeader user={user} />
      {modules.map(module => (
        <ModuleRenderer key={module.id} module={module} />
      ))}
    </Layout>
  )
}

// Vercel's ISR for auto-updating academic data
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const publications = await fetchORCIDData(user.orcid)
  return { 
    props: { publications }, 
    revalidate: 86400 // Update daily automatically
  }
}
```

### Vercel API Routes (Zero-Config Backend)
```typescript
// pages/api/publications/[orcid].ts - Automatically becomes serverless function
export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const { orcid } = req.query
  
  try {
    const publications = await fetchORCIDData(orcid as string)
    // Vercel KV for caching
    await kv.set(`publications:${orcid}`, publications, { ex: 86400 })
    res.json(publications)
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to fetch publications' })
  }
}

// pages/api/networking/connect.ts - Academic relationship management
export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const { fromUser, toUser, relationship } = req.body
  
  // Store in Vercel Postgres
  const connection = await sql`
    INSERT INTO academic_connections (from_user, to_user, relationship_type, created_at)
    VALUES (${fromUser}, ${toUser}, ${relationship}, NOW())
    RETURNING *
  `
  
  res.json(connection)
}
```

### Vercel Edge Functions for Global Performance
```typescript
// middleware.ts - Runs globally at the edge
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  // Add academic-specific headers
  const response = NextResponse.next()
  
  // Cache academic profiles aggressively
  if (request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/profile/')) {
    response.headers.set('Cache-Control', 'public, s-maxage=3600, stale-while-revalidate=86400')
  }
  
  // Handle conference networking QR codes
  if (request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/qr/')) {
    response.headers.set('X-Academic-Networking', 'enabled')
  }
  
  return response
}
```
