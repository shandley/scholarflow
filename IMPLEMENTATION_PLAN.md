## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **API Rate Limits**
   - Implement caching layer
   - Queue system for batch operations
   - Fallback to manual entry

2. **Scaling Issues**
   - Database connection pooling
   - CDN for static assets
   - Serverless function optimization

3. **Data Loss**
   - Regular backups
   - Data export functionality
   - Version history

### Business Risks
1. **Low Adoption**
   - Free tier generous enough
   - Easy onboarding
   - Clear value proposition

2. **Competition**
   - Unique features (family tree)
   - Better UX than alternatives
   - Academic-specific focus

This implementation plan provides a clear roadmap for building ScholarFlow from foundation to launch, with specific technical details and mitigation strategies for potential challenges.
