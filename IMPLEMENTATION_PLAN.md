## Technical Architecture Details

### API Route Structure
```
/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts
/api/profile/
  - index.ts (GET all, POST new)
  - [id].ts (GET, PUT, DELETE single)
  - [username]/public.ts (Public profile data)
/api/publications/
  - sync.ts (POST - sync from ORCID)
  - [id].ts (GET, PUT, DELETE)
/api/network/
  - connections.ts (GET, POST)
  - requests.ts (GET, POST, PUT)
  - visualize.ts (GET network data)
/api/analytics/
  - activity.ts (GET, POST)
  - goals.ts (GET, POST, PUT)
  - export.ts (GET - data export)
```

### Component Structure
```
components/
  common/
    - Layout.tsx
    - Navigation.tsx
    - Footer.tsx
  profile/
    - ProfileCard.tsx
    - PublicationList.tsx
    - ContactInfo.tsx
  dashboard/

    - GoalProgress.tsx
    - NetworkGraph.tsx
  forms/
    - ProfileForm.tsx

### State Management Strategy
```typescript
// Zustand stores
useAuthStore - Authentication state
useProfileStore - Current user profile
useActivityStore - Activity tracking
useNetworkStore - Connections data

// TanStack Query for server state
useProfile() - Fetch profile data
usePublications() - Fetch publications
useConnections() - Fetch network
useAnalytics() - Fetch analytics
```

    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **API Rate Limits**
   - Implement caching layer
   - Queue system for batch operations
   - Fallback to manual entry

2. **Scaling Issues**
   - Database connection pooling
   - CDN for static assets
   - Serverless function optimization

3. **Data Loss**
   - Regular backups
   - Data export functionality
   - Version history

### Business Risks
1. **Low Adoption**
   - Free tier generous enough
   - Easy onboarding
   - Clear value proposition

2. **Competition**
   - Unique features (family tree)
   - Better UX than alternatives
   - Academic-specific focus

This implementation plan provides a clear roadmap for building ScholarFlow from foundation to launch, with specific technical details and mitigation strategies for potential challenges.
